# Hi there, I am Haeji üëã

Welcome to my GitHub Profile! I‚Äôm a Data Scientist with a strong specialization in business applications. My experience spans both public and private organizations, where I've focused on data analytics and project management. I excel at bridging the gap between data science and business strategy.

My extensive experience in managing end-to-end projects has laid a solid foundation for delivering business-oriented, data-driven solutions that align with organizational goals. Collaboration with cross-functional teams and external entities of all sizes is one of my key strengths.

I have a passion for working with qualitative data, such as the spoken and written words of various stakeholders, which provide rich insights that go beyond conventional data analysis. My deep interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows me to leverage modern techniques to extract fascinating and actionable insights from textual data.

## üîç Project Highlights
[**1. NLP Portfolio**](https://github.com/haejiyun/NLP/blob/main/README.md)  
**Project: Sentiment Analysis of Airbnb Reviews in Paris**  
*Description*  
An in-depth analysis of Airbnb guest experiences using advanced NLP techniques such as Zero-shot Classification and BERT Sentiment Analysis. This project includes a comprehensive pipeline that detects language, translates non-English reviews, and categorizes sentiment and content using state-of-the-art models. The results are presented through an interactive Streamlit app.

[**2. Machine Learning Portfolio**](https://github.com/haejiyun/Machine-Learning/blob/main/README.md)  
**Project: Clustering of French Cities and Rupture Detection of Voting Behavior**  
*Description*  
A detailed analysis of French electoral behavior based on socio-economic data inspired by "Une histoire du conflit" by Thomas Piketty and Julia Cag√©. This project utilizes unsupervised learning techniques like dimensionality reduction, clustering, and rupture detection to identify patterns and shifts in voting preferences across different regions in France. The study visually explores the relationship between voting behavior and factors such as income, education, and demographics, providing deep insights into the socio-political landscape.

[**3. Data Visualization Portfolio**](https://github.com/haejiyun/Data-Visualisation/blob/main/README.md)   
**Project: Drinking Water Access Dashboard**  
*Description*  
A Tableau dashboard that visualizes global access to drinking water, with insights on population distribution, political stability, and mortality rates related to unsafe water. This project aims to guide decisions for optimizing water access policies and services.

[**4. Data Analysis Portfolio**](https://github.com/haejiyun/Data-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)   
**Project: Food Security Panorama**  
*Description*   
A comprehensive analysis of global malnutrition, food availability, and distribution. The study includes mathematical calculations to assess food security at both global and country levels, with a focus on cereal products and specific countries.

[**5. Advanced Statistics Portfolio**](https://github.com/haejiyun/Advanced-Statistics/blob/main/README.md)   
**Project: Rain Prediction with Generalized Linear Models**  
*Description*  
Predicting rainfall in Basel, Switzerland, using historical meteorological data. The project includes variable selection and the development of an efficient binary classification model to forecast the likelihood of rain.
