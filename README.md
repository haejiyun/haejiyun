# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## Hi there 👋
I’m a Data Scientist with a strong specialization in business applications. My experience spans both public and private organizations, where I've focused on data analytics and project management. I excel at bridging the gap between data science and business strategy.

My extensive experience in managing end-to-end projects has laid a solid foundation for delivering business-oriented, data-driven solutions that align with organizational goals. Collaboration with cross-functional teams and external entities of all sizes is one of my key strengths.

I have a passion for working with qualitative data, such as the spoken and written words of various stakeholders, which provide rich insights that go beyond conventional data analysis. My deep interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows me to leverage modern techniques to extract fascinating and actionable insights from textual data.
